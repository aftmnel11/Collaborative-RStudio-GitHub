# Create a pull request to ask your collaborator to merge your fork to the original repository

***

1. **GitHub**: in your repository, click on '**contribute**' and '**open pull request**'

2. **GitHub**: **make sure the base repository is Malika's original one and the head fork is yours**, both set on their main branch (these repositories should only have one branch anyway called 'main'. Branches are diverging versions of a file *within* a repository - we will not cover this concept today). Check that your requested merge does not create any conflict. If all is good, click on `Create pull request`

3. **GitHub**: write an informative message, explaining your changes to your collaborator, the author of the original repository. Click on `Create pull request`

4. **GitHub**: check to see your collaborator's response to your request and check the original repository to see your merged changes. Most likely it will be a thumbs up! But your collaborator might also **request a correction** if they spot an error. If this session is live: go see the instructor and ask them to watch while they merge your pull request.
